<h2>Angelo's Week 1 Day 1 Passion Project</h2>
<p>Here is the basic idea of my passion_project:
Basically, since I recently got into photography, it'd make sense to develop a photography related web site. I'm not really sure yet what exactly it's gonna be. But I'm considering a photo blog, or a photography resources web site, or a photography web site specifically dedicated to street photography in San Francisco.

<p>Here are the things that I learned from the video and reading homework assignment on day 1:
<div class= "bold-items">
	<ul>
	<li>Change the mindset for growth.</li>
	<li>Perseverance.</li>
	<li>Start with the end goal in mind, preferably associating it with my passions.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
